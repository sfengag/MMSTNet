This repo is the implementation of our manuscript entitled Region-Aware Hierarchical Graph Contrastive Learning for Ride-Hailing Driver Profiling. The code is based on Pytorch 1.13.1, and tested on Ubuntu 18 with NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU.

In this study, we present a region-aware Hierarchical Graph Contrastive Learning (HGCL) model for ride-hailing driver profiling. The model consists of three modules: trajectory transformer, regional driving state extractor and multi-view urban graph encoder. Then obtained driver profiles can be used as extra features for various downstream tasks.
